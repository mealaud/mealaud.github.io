me!
{{% /figure %}}

Hello! My name is Mealaud Mokhtarzad but I usually go by Mel. I’m a pure math major at UCLA (class of ’24). As of a few days ago, I am now (officially!) and incoming math graduate student at UNC Chapel Hill!!!! :)))) My interests include and are usually limited to: math, rock skipping, clouds, and writing. If you need to contact me, [m.mokhtarzad at ucla dot edu]() is usually a good way to reach me.


## Cool People
<!-- Hoober Loo, Kelanu Ranganap, King Chud, Logang Bigslap, Andrea Borkhermerfererger -->

* [Hunter Liu](https://hunterliu.xyz/) – Hunter is a lovely, epic friend I met in our graduate complex analysis class. He was wearing cat ears when we first met which weirded me out a bit, but we ended up talking a lot and I figured out he’s one of the coolest people I’ve ever met.

* [Kelanu Ranganath](https://kelanu.com) – Kelanu is so cool! We met at our physics lab internship during the summer of 2021 and we’ve been great friends since then. I love this guy a lot. 

* [Kyle Chui](https://github.com/kylechui) – I met the back of Kyle’s head during the summer going into my high school senior year when we took multivariable together at a local community college. We ended up taking another course together the coming fall where I met the front of his head and found out he was a cool guy. He’s still really cool. He’s also rich and famous, so that’s a plus. Check out his Neovim plugin!

* [Logan Hyslop](https://loganhyslop.github.io/) - Logan is mega cool and mega cracked. We met his freshman year (my sorta junior year). He actually does math (good stuff at that). B)

* [Andrea Bourque](https://www.math.lsu.edu/~abour99/) - Andrea is a big ol' math nerd and is very cool, but never talk to them after they've had mac'n'cheese. _shudders_
