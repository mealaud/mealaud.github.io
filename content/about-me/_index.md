me!

Hello! My name is Mealaud Mokhtarzad but I usually go by Mel. 
I’m a pure mathematics graduate student at UNC Chapel Hill!
My interests include and are usually limited to: math, rock skipping, clouds, and writing.
If you need to contact me, [mealaud at proton dot me]() is usually a good way to reach me.


## Cool People
* [Hunter Liu](https://hunterliu.xyz/) – Hunter is a lovely, epic friend I met in our graduate complex analysis class. He was wearing cat ears when we first met which weirded me out a bit, but we ended up talking a lot and I figured out he’s one of the coolest people I’ve ever met.
* [Kelanu Ranganath](https://kelanu.com) – Kelanu is so cool! We met at our physics lab internship during the summer of 2021 and we’ve been great friends since then. I love this guy a lot. 
* [Kyle Chui](https://github.com/kylechui) – I met the back of Kyle’s head during the summer going into my high school senior year when we took multivariable together at a local community college. We ended up taking another course together the coming fall where I met the front of his head and found out he was a cool guy. He’s still really cool. He’s also rich and famous, so that’s a plus. Check out his Neovim plugin!
* [Aaron Machuca](https://aaronmachuca.com/) - Aaron visited me in North Carolina recently and we had the most impactful conversation I've had in over a year. He listened to me and fought back against my negative thoughts in a way which was compelling, which has never really happened to me before. It was the absolute confidence he had in me and the subtle but palpable love he shared with me that left me and still leave me floored. He's [jus' bein' 'onest](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/b-y62QvnMaI) but he does it with a tact I have never experienced. A genuine care and love shines through with his words of wisdom, but his message is never lost in this wash of warmth. I love Aaron a lot. I love him, his actions, his core, and what he shares with the world —— what he shares with me. Thank you for who you _choose_ to be.
* [Logan Hyslop](https://loganhyslop.github.io/) - Logan is mega cool and mega cracked. We met his freshman year (my sorta junior year). He actually does math (good stuff at that). B)
* [Andrea Bourque](https://www.math.lsu.edu/~abour99/) - Andrea is a big ol' math nerd and is very cool, but never talk to them after they've had mac'n'cheese. _shudders_
* [Liz](https://linkyxstart.blogspot.com) - I met Liz first as Hunter's girlfriend, but Liz eventually became a part of my world too. She is wonderful, kind, and a former [League of Legends addict...](https://linkyxstart.blogspot.com/2024/04/sobriety-from-league-of-legends.html)
