I want to try to make a Zettelkasten idea map. I think it'll be cool. :)

Current idea is to have this page be a brief description, map option on the right, table of contents on the left. I think it'll be neat.

Map can be filtered through (ripgrep style).

Currently I'm just gonna be taking notes lol.
