summary: "What am I to become?"
---

In my other writings I have oft thought about "How do I forgive myself for the things I do not become?" 
(e.g., the [second]({{<relref "/hobbies/writing/atlas-the-dive">}}) and [third]({{<relref "/hobbies/writing/atlas-the-sanctity-of-the-heavens">}}) Atlas pieces.) 
It is a valid and real worry, but not one that is well-formed or precisely stated. 
What might I not become? 
What traits do I hope to possess?

Because the nature of desire is that of ebbing and flowing, what am I to do?
Per [On the Impermanence of Aspirations]({{<relref "/axioms/on-the-impermanence-of-aspirations">}}), we see that we *must act now*.
This tendency for change and uncertainty is not reason to linger in a state of disrepair and disdain for oneself!; one must push onwards, upwards, and, most importantly, towards who one wants to become.

My current and past goals will be listed below (in no particular order).
These goals may be basic and obvious, but they are important to note for times of potential distress.
