My axioms are not only beliefs I hold near and dear, but also are a codified set of laws to which I _must_ adhere.

[Axiom #1]({{<relref "/axioms#okay">}}) can easily be read as a belief, but, more importantly, **it is a promise**. 
And, like all promises to myself, I will keep it. (cf. [On the Worth of My Word]({{<relref "on-the-worth-of-my-word">}})).

My understanding of "it being okay" means I will find my life meaningful. (cf. [Axiom #4]({{<relref "/axioms#meaningful">}}).)
Because I cannot guarantee my unconditional happiness and appreciation for all that is around me, I instead appreciate what I have done, i.e., I may even take the slightest pride in.
In other words, **I must make my own life meaningful**. (cf. [Axiom #2]({{<relref "/axioms#atlas">}}).)
