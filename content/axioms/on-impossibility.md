summary: "Who am I to speak on destiny?"
---

Who am I to say what is possible and what is not?
Restricting such speech to only things describing myself, it seems to become far more "reasonable", but is that right?
Fate is far greater than I so who am I say that something I believe is impossible _truly is impossible_?
Anything is possible until it is not.
I must bear witness to this fact in my efforts.
May my destiny subsume me.
