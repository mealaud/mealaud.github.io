summary: "What am I to do if my word means nothing?"
---

What is the worth of my word?
Iâ€™d like to believe my word has worth, but does it?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Though at conflict with what I would like to believe, I do not give my words value.
I make empty promises to myself often and nothing comes of them (as one would expect).
Why would I make those promises at all? Because I am under the guise that my word does have worth and that I give it the respect necessary for it to have value.
That must change.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I must truly value my promises and act to corroborate this fact-to-be.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Moreover, what is life but a promise to oneself to live? And I must live.
