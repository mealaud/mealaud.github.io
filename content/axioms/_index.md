How does one live? 
How must I live?
I am not certain of this.
There are no unshakeable axioms in my life but there are some suppositions which allow me to live a life I find enjoyable.
This is to say: what I describe may not be for everyone, but it is for me.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

A new addition to these axioms will be those of interest to interpersonal relationships. 
Reflecting on this now, I feel I have well-addressed rules for my conduct with _myself_, but not with _others_. 
And, being someone who loves social interaction, I've thought about this a lot.

### Intrapersonal
#### Axiom I.1 {#okay}
>>> _It will be okay._
{{%nl%}}
I don't know what okay will mean in say a year, or even a week from now, but I know that I will know on that day itself. I can't predict a priori what my life will be like, but I may live it and decide in any moment of introspection. Regardless of what this definition may be, I know that I can endure. I know that I can persevere. I know I can. I can.

#### Axiom I.2 {#atlas}
>>> _I am my world's Atlas._
{{%nl%}}
I must lift the weight of my world. My hands may falter, my knees may buckle, but I cannot yield---I must not yield. This is not to say that I must suffer, or succeed, alone. This is to point out that I am the crux of every action in my life. I aim the executer of thoughts. I am the executer of my actions. I am the principle bearer of the burden of my life---in all its successes and failures.

#### Axiom I.3 {#restraint}
>>> _There is no freedom without restraint._
{{%nl%}}
Given infinite choices, it is a priori impossible to decide what to do. If I am able to do anything, I will do nothing. Realizing this for myself, I saw that if I am act in any sense, I must constrain myself. I must limit choice my choices to make choices. 

#### Axiom I.4 {#meaningful}
>>> _I must find my own life meaningful._
{{%nl%}}
I say something is meaningful if it is something that requires determination, persistence, creativity, or anything I feel even a slight pride in. 

#### Axiom I.5 {#purposefulness}
>>> _I must act with purpose._
{{%nl%}}
A life cannot be meaningful if never lived with intent and purpose.
However, I further choose to live _every moment_ with intent and purpose. 
Relaxing is fine -- with purpose.
Working is fine -- with purpose.
Living is fine -- with purpose.
There is no less that I may do.

<!-- #### Axiom I.6 {#mundane} -->
<!-- >>> _The mundane can be beautiful._ -->



### Interpersonal

#### Axiom II.1 {#golden}
>>> _Treat others how you want to be treated._ 
{{%nl%}}
I can read no minds but my own, yet I must act, so I must empathize.
