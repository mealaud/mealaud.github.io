How does one live? How must I live? I am not certain of this. There are no unshakeable axioms in my life but there are some suppositions which allow me to live a life I find enjoyable. This is to say: what I describe may not be for everyone, but it is for me.

#### Axiom #1 {#okay}
>> 1. It will be okay.
{{%nl%}}
I don't know what okay will mean in say a year, or even a week from now, but I know that I will know on that day itself. I can't predict a priori what my life will be like, but I may live it and decide in any moment of introspection. Regardless of what this definition may be, I know that I can endure. I know that I can persevere. I know I can. I can.

#### Axiom #2 {#atlas}
>> 2. I am my world's Atlas.
{{%nl%}}
I must lift the weight of my world. My hands may falter, my knees may buckle, but I cannot yield---I must not yield. This is not to say that I must suffer, or succeed, alone. This is to point out that I am the crux of every action in my life. I aim the executer of thoughts. I am the executer of my actions. I am the principle bearer of the burden of my life---in all its successes and failures.

#### Axiom #3 {#restraint}
>> 3. There is no freedom without restraint.
{{%nl%}}
Given infinite choices, it is a priori impossible to decide what to do. If I am able to do anything, I will do nothing. Realizing this for myself, I saw that if I am act in any sense, I must constrain myself. I must limit choice my choices to make choices. 

#### Axiom #4 {#meaningful}
>> 4. I must find my own life meaningful.
{{%nl%}}
I say something is meaningful if it is something that requires determination, persistence, creativity, or anything I feel even a slight pride in.
