I spoke to my friend Charles today. 
I wasn't feeling well and he reached out to me to check in; he's a wonderful friend.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

While talking, he tried to have me describe the worst possible outcome of my current situation.
In a moment of reflection I realized that "None of them are catastrophic, they just feel bad."
He looked at me puzzled and unsure what I meant.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I next described how at times I felt as though my first axiom, that of hope, leaves me from time to time.
He asked me befuddled: "Wait. If this is an axiom, why are you questioning it? How does that work?"
In a moment of genuine care and confusion he hit the nail on its head.
An unspoken issue which has left me stumped whenever I hit an existential wall: if my negative emotion is irrational, how do I combat it? I can't usually argue it? _How do I think myself into having hope?_
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Generally speaking, I don't think you can. 
My axioms are _too theoretical_. 
My axioms which are laid on faith are fickle; they can be argued against on a bad day and argued for on a good one. 
None are unshakeable —— even to me.

{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}
For all of these reasons, I present myself a new collection of axioms —— in particular, _actionable_ axioms.


#### Axiom 1 {#charles}
>>> _Do._

To improve one's situation something must be done.
I must do. 
No mention of things being "okay" or "good" is needed; I must continue.
I must hold up my heavens.
I must withstand.
I must do.







<!-- ### Before March 17th, 2025. -->
<!---->
<!-- How does one live?  -->
<!-- How must I live? -->
<!-- I am not certain of this. -->
<!-- There are no unshakeable axioms in my life but there are some suppositions which allow me to live a life I find enjoyable. -->
<!-- This is to say: what I describe may not be for everyone, but it is for me. -->
<!-- {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}} -->
<!---->
<!-- A new addition to these axioms will be those of interest to interpersonal relationships.  -->
<!-- Reflecting on this now, I feel I have well-addressed rules for my conduct with _myself_, but not with _others_.  -->
<!-- And, being someone who loves social interaction, I've thought about this a lot. -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Intrapersonal -->
<!-- #### Axiom I.1 {#okay} -->
<!-- >>> _It will be okay._ -->
<!-- {{%nl%}} -->
<!-- I don't know what okay will mean in say a year, or even a week from now, but I know that I will know on that day itself. I can't predict a priori what my life will be like, but I may live it and decide in any moment of introspection. Regardless of what this definition may be, I know that I can endure. I know that I can persevere. I know I can. I can. -->
<!---->
<!-- #### Axiom I.2 {#atlas} -->
<!-- >>> _I am my world's Atlas._ -->
<!-- {{%nl%}} -->
<!-- I must lift the weight of my world. My hands may falter, my knees may buckle, but I cannot yield---I must not yield. This is not to say that I must suffer, or succeed, alone. This is to point out that I am the crux of every action in my life. I aim the executer of thoughts. I am the executer of my actions. I am the principle bearer of the burden of my life---in all its successes and failures. -->
<!---->
<!-- #### Axiom I.3 {#restraint} -->
<!-- >>> _There is no freedom without restraint._ -->
<!-- {{%nl%}} -->
<!-- Given infinite choices, it is a priori impossible to decide what to do. If I am able to do anything, I will do nothing. Realizing this for myself, I saw that if I am act in any sense, I must constrain myself. I must limit choice my choices to make choices.  -->
<!---->
<!-- #### Axiom I.4 {#meaningful} -->
<!-- >>> _I must find my own life meaningful._ -->
<!-- {{%nl%}} -->
<!-- I say something is meaningful if it is something that requires determination, persistence, creativity, or anything I feel even a slight pride in.  -->
<!---->
<!-- #### Axiom I.5 {#purposefulness} -->
<!-- >>> _I must act with purpose._ -->
<!-- {{%nl%}} -->
<!-- A life cannot be meaningful if never lived with intent and purpose. -->
<!-- However, I further choose to live _every moment_ with intent and purpose.  -->
<!-- Relaxing is fine -- with purpose. -->
<!-- Working is fine -- with purpose. -->
<!-- Living is fine -- with purpose. -->
<!-- There is no less that I may do. -->
<!---->
<!-- #### Axiom I.6 {#mundane} -->
<!-- >>> _The mundane can be beautiful._ -->
<!---->
<!---->
<!---->
<!-- ### Interpersonal -->
<!---->
<!-- #### Axiom II.1 {#golden} -->
<!-- >>> _Treat others how you want to be treated._  -->
<!-- {{%nl%}} -->
<!-- I can read no minds but my own, yet I must act, so I must empathize. -->
