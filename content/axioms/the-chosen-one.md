While heading home on the bus today, I was curious about complacency; specifically, my complacency.
My graduate-school career has been marred by lows and elevated by highs, but I have had far more lows than highs.
In some sense, I am below where I was in undergrad.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

In undergrad, I was not a good student.
However, I suppose it was not necessary yet to develop such skills.
I didn't learn how to study; I didn't learn how to trudge; I didn't learn how to learn.

As a graduate student, I was expected to have come in with these basic abilities mastered and practiced.
Like I said above, I haven't, however.

What are the characteristics I'm missing that I want to possess?
Academically:
1. I want to be willing to do and to actually do problems which seem "unenlightening" or "ugly".


I've been refusing to do questions that seem like or are (admittedly) a _grind_. 
You must trudge through the problem to get some form of solution.

2. I want to review, study, practice what I have not mastered. 

In particular, I've taken 5 exams this semester: 2 have gone mediocre-ly, and the 3 remaining have gone _terribly_.
Both subjects I want to want to care about, and often do, but I have this belief in me that it will be okay.
That if I just do my homework, I will achieve my goals and succeed.
That if I just do my requirements, I will ascend and surpass what I had envisioned for myself.
Currently, I just get the bad score, stare at it, feel bad, don't change anything, and repeat the cycle when after the next exam comes around.

3. I heard from my roommate, that a professor of ours told an admittedly funny joke: "If you're smart and lazy, do algebra. If you're smart and hardworking, do topology. If you're just hardworking, do analysis."
I want to qualify for doing whatever I would like to do.

I want to be smart and hardworking.
But often times, I fall short and feel irreparably so.
But this is not the case.

One thing I often say while playing Rocket League, I repeatedly say "It's not over until it's over." 
I'll be down 5 goals with 5 seconds left and it looks that I will lose.
I often do.
Regardless, I do not give up.
Even after I've lost, I don't give up hope.
I can win next time.
This is not kicking-the-can-down-the-road, it is the belief that I can improve if I don't give up.
I can improve if I don't give up.

4. I don't want to give up.
