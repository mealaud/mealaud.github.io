summary: "Is my busy-ness and my actions/inaction a reflection of a failure?"
---



I've recently started graduate school and, for the first time in a long time, I feel that I am _busy_. I am **busy**.
My obligations are as follows (in no particular order):
1. NSF GRFP application
2. Research Playground
3. Differential geometry research project
4. Real Analysis course
5. Algebra course
6. Topology course
7. Teaching/Grading

These are my _obligations_. 

>> These are the actions that fulfill me intellectually.

I want to do all of them, of course (!), but there are things outside of these that I want to doâ€”â€”that I feel I _need_ to do.

1. Cloud watching
2. Painting
3. Rock skipping

These are my desires.

>> These are the actions which fulfill me.

The quality of mine which colors my life experiences the most is my recognition of the common surreal, or, more conventionally put, the mundane.

My understanding and appreciation for the world, my hobbies, my enamorament with anything and everything around me leaves me happy and ecstatic in moments and places seemingly devoid of joy and inspiration.

>> My life experience has been informed by this appreciation.

But now, I don't feel that as often and I certainly don't participate in it nearly at all.

In a personal essay I wrote many suns ago, I said that

>>>> "I am a child, not in the sense that I have not matured, but because I never outgrew that innate sense of wonder"

And reading this nearly brings tears to my eyes.
