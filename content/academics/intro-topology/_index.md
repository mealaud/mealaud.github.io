This semester (Fall 2024), I am taking (introductory) topology at UNC (Math 681).

The order of posts will be inherited from the order of my lectures (by Professor Philip Tosteson), but the material will not be his lectures alone.
Indeed, I want these notes to be a documented attempt (and success) of mastering point-set topology.
Because of this, I will be including and drawing from resources not just from my current course, but also other texts/ideas I have read/seen in my time studying mathematics.
