Kelanu called me today and told me about a _really_ weird functional result: the convex hull of a bounded set is not necessarily bounded.  which came from an exercise in Rudin's _Functional Analysis_:

{{% MathEnv "x" %}}
Let $ X $ be a topological vector space. All sets mentioned below are understood to be the subsets of $ X $. Prove the following statements.
1. The convex hull of every open set is open. _Reasonable. Sure._
2. If $ X $ is locally convex then the convex hull of every bounded set is bounded. _Sure. Sounds good!_ (This is false without local convexity. _WHAT???????????_)
{{% /MathEnv %}}

Instantly, I realized I didn't remember what local convexity meant; but I refused to believe the result anyway!
This is called a _conviction_[^lol].






[^lol]: no lmfao
