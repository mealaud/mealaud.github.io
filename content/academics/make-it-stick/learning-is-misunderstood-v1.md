summary: My first pass of the first chapter of _Make It Stick_.
---

The first thing that the authors discuss is the story of Matt, a pilot.
One of his plane's engines is dying and he needs to fly for another 10 miles, but how can he do this?
Though we don't follow his actions in their complexity and depth, he does!
Indeed, _he must_ understand what he's doing and be ready to execute at a moment's notice just as he did.
This leads us to our first definition in this book, that of _learning_. 
>> {{% tdf "Learning" %}}  is the act of acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities.

The authors then state three facts.
1. To be useful, learning requires memory, so what we've learned is still there later when we need it.
2. We need to keep learning and remembering all our lives.[^good at learning]
3. Learning is an acquired skill, and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive.[^counterintuitive]

# Claims we Make in This Book
1. Learning is deeper and more durable when it takes effort.

They say that easy learning is like writing in sand and so it disappears very quickly. 
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I think this makes a lot of sense to me as when I study math (or really do anything with a lot of effort), I really learn it well. 
I remember it at the least.
Like I've worked with topological spaces so much that if you woke me up in the middle of the night, I think I'd quickly give the correct definition of what a topology is.

2. We are _poor judges_ of when we are learning well and when we're not.

When learning is taking time and feels slow, it feels unproductive, so we often jump ship for methods that promise faster results even if these results are temporary!! (Not that we know a priori). 
This makes sense... I've done this too much in the past. 

3. _Rereading text_ and _massed practice_ of a skill or new knowledge are by far the preferred study strategies for most people, but they're also among the _least productive_. 

For reference, {{% tdf "massed practive" %}} means the single-minded, rapid fire repetition of something you're trying to burn into memory.
(cf. the idea of "practice-practice-practice" that people usually talk about).
They say further that cramming via rereading and massed practice give rise to feelings of fluency that seem to indicate mastery, but with true mastery and durability of knowledge as a goal, cramming is largely a waste of time.
I suddenly feel quite ashamed lmfao.

4. {{% tdf "Retrieval practice" %}}, meaning recalling facts or concepts or events from memory, is a more effective learning strategy than rereading. 
Flashcards are a simple example.
Retrieval strengthens the memory and interrupts the process of forgetting. (Wow! I've never thought of that before!) 
A single simple quiz after reading or after a lecture greatly enhances learning and remembering than just rereading or reviewing lecture notes.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The brain is not a muscle but the neural pathways that make up the body of learning do get stronger when the memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced.
Periodic practice (like we mentioned before) interrupts the process of forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.

5. Spacing out practice and getting a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects retrieval is hard and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables for versatile application of it in later settings. 

6. Trying to solve a problem _before being taught the solution_ leads to better learning, even when the errors are made in the attempt.

7. The idea that you learn better when you receive instruction in a form consistent with your preferred learning style is _not supported by empirical research_.

Moreover, you learn better when you draw on all of your aptitudes and resourcefulness, than when you limit instruction or experience to the style you find most amenable.

8. When you're good at extracting the underlying principles or "rules" that differentiate types of problems, you're more successful at picking the right solutions in unfamiliar situations. 

This skill is better acquired through _interleaved and varied practice_ than massed practice.

9. We are all _susceptible to illusions_ that cna hijack our judgement of what we know and can do. 

Testing helps calibrate our judgements of what we've learned.
In virtually all areas of learning, you build better mastery when you use testing as a tool to identify and bring up your areas of weakness.

10. All new learning requires a _foundation of prior knowledge_.

For example, you need to know what a limit is before you can learn what an integral or derivative is.

11. If you just engage in mechanical repetition, you can hit the limit of what you can keep in mind, but if you practice _elaboration_, there is *no known limit to how much you can learn*.

{{% tdf "Elaboration" %}} is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with the what you already know.
The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be, and the more connections you create will help you remember it later.

12. Putting new knowledge into a _larger context_ helps learning.

e.g., If you're trying to learn an abstraction, it's easier when you ground it in something concrete that you already know.

13. People who learn to _extract key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model_ and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery.

A {{% tdf "mental model" %}} is a mental representations of some external reality. 

14. Many people believe that their intellectual ability is hard-wired from birth, and that failure ot meet a learning challenge is an indictment of their native ability, but every time you learn something new, _you change the brain_.

We start our life with our initial conditions (genes), sure, but it's also true that we become capable through the learning and development of mental models that enable us to reason, solve, and create. 
i.e., *The elements that shape your intellectual abilities lie to a surprising extent within your own control*.
Understanding this enables you to see failure as a badge of effort and a source of useful information —— needing to go deeper or try a different strategy.
You need to understand that when learning is hard, you're doing important work. 
To understand that striving and setbacks, are essential if you are to surpass your current level of performance towards true expertise. 
Making mistakes and correcting them builds the bridges to advanced learning.


# Empirical Evidence versus Theory, Lore, and Intuition

## People Misunderstand Learning

1. People often think enough exposures to something means it will not be forgotten. 
_This is not the case._

2. Many teachers believe that if they can make learning easier and faster, the learning will be better. 
_This is not the case._ 

Research actually says the opposite! Research tells us that when learning is harder, it's stronger and lasts longer.

3. It's widely believed by teachers, trainers, and coaches that the most effective way to master a new skill is to give it dogged single-minded focus, practicing over and over until you've got it down.
We often have a lot of faith in this one because this is how most make fast gains during the learning phase of massed practice. _This is not the case._ 

Research tells us that these achieved gains are transient and are lost quickly.

Rereading stuff has three strikes against it when it comes to being an effective learning strategy: 1) it is time consuming, 2) it doesn't result in durable memory, and 3) it often involves some kind of unwitting self-deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel like mastery of the content.
>> The hours immersed in rereading can seem like due diligence, but the amount of study time is no measure of mastery.

>> Learning is stronger when it matters, when the abstract is made concrete and personal.

## Early Evidence

In a study, it was found that exposure did not increase retention.
This has been reproduced, confirmed, and elaborated to get that *repetition does not lead to good long-term memory.*
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Upshot of some studies: it makes sense to reread a text once if there's been a meaningful lapse of time since the first reading, but doing multiple readings in close succession is a time consuming study strategy that yields negligible benefits at the expense of much more effective strategies that take less time.


## Illusions of Knowing

If we don't test ourselves, we don't know what we don't know (or where we are weak).
Just practicing and "studying" seems like you're mastering the material (after all you can recall it right you read it...) but that doesn't tell us whether we actually know it or have mastered it. 
Testing comes in handy here as we can then use it to figure out what we need to improve on and whether we actually know something and are able to apply them in new contexts.



# Knowledge: Not Sufficient, but Necessary

"[O]ne cannot apply what one knows in a practical manner if one does not know anything to apply".
Mastery requires both the possession of ready knowledge and the conceptual understanding of how to use it.


# Testing: Dipstick versus Learning Tool

If we stop thinking of testing as a determiner of whether you know something and think of testing as practicing retrieval of learning from memory, we open ourselves to a new possibility: _the use of testing as a tool for learning._
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

One of the most striking research findings is the power of active retrieval —— testing —— to strengthen memory, and that the more effortful the retrieval, the stronger the benefit.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The act of retrieving learning from memory has two profound benefits. 
1. It tells you what you know and don't know, and therefore where to focus further study to improve the areas where you're weak.
2. Recalling what you have learned causes your brain to reconsolidate the memory, which strengthens its connections to what you already know and makes it easier for you to recall in the future.

i.e., Retrieval —— testing —— interrupts forgetting.


# The Takeaway

1. For the most part, we are going about learning in the wrong ways, and are giving poor advice to those coming after us.

2. We know of simple and practical strategies that anybody can use, at any point in life, to learn better and remember longer: various forms of retrieval practice, such as low-stakes quizzing and self-testing, spacing out practice, interleaving the practice of different but related topics or skills, trying to solve a problem before being taught the solution, distilling the underlying principles or rules that differentiate different types of problems, and so on. 

Because learning is an iterative process that requires that you revisit what you have learned earlier and continually update it and connect it with new knowledge, we circle through these topics several times along the way. 















[^good at learning]: They also say that if you're good at learning you have an advantage in life.
[^counterintuitive]: We will be persuaded of this later.
