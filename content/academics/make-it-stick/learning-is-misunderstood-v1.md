# Introduction 

The first thing that the authors discuss is the story of Matt, a pilot.
One of his plane's engines is dying and he needs to fly for another 10 miles, but how can he do this?
Though we don't follow his actions in their complexity and depth, he does!
Indeed, _he must_ understand what he's doing and be ready to execute at a moment's notice just as he did.
This leads us to our first definition in this book, that of _learning_. 
>> {{% tdf "Learning" %}}  is the act of acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities.

The authors then state three facts.
1. To be useful, learning requires memory, so what we've learned is still there later when we need it.
2. We need to keep learning and remembering all our lives.[^good at learning]
3. Learning is an acquired skill, and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive.[^counterintuitive]

# Claims we Make in This Book
1. Learning is deeper and more durable when it takes effort.

They say that easy learning is like writing in sand and so it disappears very quickly.

I think this makes a lot of sense to me as when I study math (or really do anything with a lot of effort), I really learn it well. 
I remember it at the least.
Like I've worked with topological spaces so much that if you woke me up in the middle of the night, I think I'd quickly give the correct definition of what a topology is.

2. We are _poor judges_ of when we are learning well and when we're not.

When learning is taking time and feels slow, it feels unproductive, so we often jump ship for methods that promise faster results even if these results are temporary!! (Not that we know a priori). 
This makes sense... I've done this too much in the past. 

3. _Rereading text_ and _massed practice_ of a skill or new knowledge are by far the preferred study strategies for most people, but they're also among the _least productive_. 

For reference, {{% tdf "massed practive" %}} means the single-minded, rapid fire repetition of something you're trying to burn into memory.
(cf. the idea of "practice-practice-practice" that people usually talk about).
They say further that cramming via rereading and massed practice give rise to feelings of fluency that seem to indicate mastery, but with true mastery and durability of knowledge as a goal, cramming is largely a waste of time.
I suddenly feel quite ashamed lmfao.

4. {{% tdf "Retrieval practice" %}}, meaning recalling facts or concepts or events from memory, is a more effective learning strategy than rereading. 
Flashcards are a simple example.
Retrieval strengthens the memory and interrupts the process of forgetting. (Wow! I've never thought of that before!) 
A single simple quiz after reading or after a lecture greatly enhances learning and remembering than just rereading or reviewing lecture notes.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The brain is not a muscle but the neural pathways that make up the body of learning do get stronger when the memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced.
Periodic practice (like we mentioned before) interrupts the process of forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.

5. Spacing out practice and getting a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects retrieval is hard and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables for versatile application of it in later settings.





[^good at learning]: They also say that if you're good at learning you have an advantage in life.
[^counterintuitive]: We will be persuaded of this later.
