# Introduction 

The first thing that the authors discuss is the story of Matt, a pilot.
One of his plane's engines is dying and he needs to fly for another 10 miles, but how can he do this?
Though we don't follow his actions in their complexity and depth, he does!
Indeed, _he must_ understand what he's doing and be ready to execute at a moment's notice just as he did.
This leads us to our first definition in this book, that of _learning_. 
>> {{% tdf "Learning" %}}  is the act of acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities.

The authors then state three facts.
1. To be useful, learning requires memory, so what we've learned is still there later when we need it.
2. We need to keep learning and remembering all our lives.[^good at learning]
3. Learning is an acquired skill, and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive.[^counterintuitive]

# Claims we Make in This Book







[^good at learning]: They also say that if you're good at learning you have an advantage in life.
[^counterintuitive]: We will be persuaded of this later.
