### Preface
This is an experiment started purely out of frustration with myself. 
(And this is being posted on my website for greater accountability, as I do not want to viewed as someone who is lazy.)
Day after day, I spent hours upon hours doing things that don't bring me closer to my chosen goals, my [my sacred commandments]({{<relref "/axioms/on-the-impermanence-of-aspirations">}}). 
Indeed, the times spent on my meaningful activities, sans social interactions, averages around an hour a day.
In essence, I am skating by —— I am coasting! 
To me, this is patently immoral.
Or, at least, me continuing this pattern of time wasting would be immoral.

To remedy this, I will be conducting an experiment of sorts: (as dumb as it sounds) I will manage my time.
Even writing this feels pitiful...

### My (current class) responsibilities
My current responsibilities are:
1. Finish my differential geometry research problem by the end of the quarter.
2. Finish my linguistics class.
3. Finish my video game music class.

All of these goals have, at least somewhat, concrete goals. 
For linguistics and video game music, I am explicitly given lectures and homeworks, and readings, respectively. 
Research is a bit harder to state because it is far more technical, but I am essentially given a goal each week and work towards completing that.

### My benchmarks
I am setting the following goals:
1. Two hours per day spent on research (in the form of reading papers, thinking about questions, and attempting computations). Essentially, anything that is a step towards my goals.
2. One hour per day spent on linguistics (mainly lectures but also for starting assignments (like essays) early).
3. Thirty minutes per day on video game music (mainly reading, but also starting my final essay).
