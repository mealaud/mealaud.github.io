These are my notes on complex analysis! 
I'm going to base them on three main sources: 
1. David Ullrich's _Complex Made Simple_;
2. Lars Ahlfor's _Complex Analysis_; and
3. Terence Tao's [Complex Analysis Notes](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/246a-notes-0-the-complex-numbers/){{%nl%}}
I will also be assuming basic familiarity with complex numbers (i.e., their definition as ordered pairs of real numbers with multiplication defined on them).{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}
I hope to finally understand complex analysis by writing these, hopefully...
