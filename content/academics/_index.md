My academic stuff goes here! That includes my notes, scribbles, or any other thoughts that seem relevant to math or anything else I have a scholarly interest in. 

### A comment on my notes

My notes are my documented attempt (and eventual mastery) of the topic of study.
For this reason, they are not solely based on a single lecture or a single individual's line of thought. 
Indeed, they will be a (hopefully well) curated collection of my understandings and thoughts on the subject matter being discussed, which are likely informed by a combination of lectures, textbooks, videos, and conversations with others.

Though these are written for me, I hope they are helpful to you too. :)

Good luck and have fun! o7
