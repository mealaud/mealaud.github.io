I dream of places like Gaudineer Knob, West Virginia.
{{%nl%}}
Covered in a thick layer of green.
{{%nl%}}
The mossiest place I've ever wished to see.
{{%nl%}}
Undisturbed.
{{%nl%}}
Serene.
{{%nl%}}
Beautiful.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I want to sit down on nature's softest bed and feel at one with the green surrounding me.
{{%nl%}}
I want to reach down and pet the moss;
{{%nl%}}
I want to caress the Earth.
{{%nl%}}
I want to witness the beauty of nature and understand my place.
{{%nl%}}
I am merely a creature sitting atop the moss.
{{%nl%}}
I am merely someone who appreciates the softest of realities.
{{%nl%}}
Then why do I make mine so hard?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Moss is simple seeming.
{{%nl%}}
It's soft.
{{%nl%}}
It's green.
{{%nl%}}
It's damp.
{{%nl%}}
But under its lush are its roots.
{{%nl%}}
Planted deep into the soft ground, 
{{%nl%}}
moisture trapped by the inches tall canopy above it,
{{%nl%}}
the roots expand into a network which survives this moss even as time passes and rain refuses to fall.
{{%nl%}}
The moss withstands, so why can't I?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The moss is uneventful.
{{%nl%}}
Being as small as it is, it doesn't sway in the wind;
{{%nl%}}
Being as soft as it is, it doesn't push against the things above it;
{{%nl%}}
Being as damp as it is, it doesn't squish under the weight of a foot or hoof;
{{%nl%}}
Being as it is, it is beautiful.
{{%nl%}}
Being as I am, am I?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The moss is inspiring.
{{%nl%}}
Unassuming but important.
{{%nl%}}
A background without which the world is hollow,
{{%nl%}}
A beauty among nature's majesty,
{{%nl%}}
Moss is wonderful. As am I.
