I still haven't painted. Regardless,
{{%nl%}}
My world has been colored.
{{%nl%}}
In beautiful pastels, warm greys, and blazing blues 
{{%nl%}}
My world has been calmed.

Sediments still build. My watercolor waves can only do so much.
{{%nl%}}
But these watercolored tides slowly bur surely wear down the sands on my axons.
{{%nl%}}
Water can only do so much given so little time.
{{%nl%}}
It's been a month since I started therapy again.
{{%nl%}}
My shape is being smoothed by gentle watercolors.
