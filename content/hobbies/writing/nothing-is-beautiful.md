summary: "A study of everything."

I was born from nothing into everything.
{{%nl%}}
Eventually I will return.
{{%nl%}}
I will ascend to nothing-hood and shed the everything.
{{%nl%}}
Regardless, nothing brings me joy.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I love clouds.
{{%nl%}}
I don't see anything in particular about them.
{{%nl%}}
Their shapes, their colors, nothing about them,
{{%nl%}}
Catches my eye quite like their essence does.
{{%nl%}}
I'm still not sure what that is.
{{%nl%}}
Regardless, their nothing is everything I love about them.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I love rock skipping.
{{%nl%}}
It is serenity punctuated by hops and jumps of a stone skimming above the heads of the fish below.
{{%nl%}}
Though clear, their home is not made of glass.
{{%nl%}}
They think nothing of these stones I throw.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

My nothings are sweet and delightful.
{{%nl%}}
Their beauty overwhelms as the clouds reflect off the rippling water in front.
