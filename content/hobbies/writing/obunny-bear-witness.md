O'Bunny under my bed,
{{%nl%}}
Are you alive, are you dead?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The closer I get to you the faster you flee.
{{%nl%}}
My breath, my plea.
{{%nl%}}
It scares you.
{{%nl%}}
It scares me too.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

O'Bunny under my bed,
{{%nl%}}
Resting permanently below my head,
{{%nl%}}
May you bear witness to me too,
{{%nl%}}
As I do to you.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

O'Bunny under my bed,
{{%nl%}}
Do you see red?
{{%nl%}}
I sweep away your friends,
{{%nl%}}
Your family is brushed to their end,
{{%nl%}}
I swear my brooms bristles,
{{%nl%}}
They are as soft as morning-dewed thistles.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

O'Bunny under my bed,
{{%nl%}}
You protest!, you detest!, the methods with which I treat your dead.
{{%nl%}}
You say "wooshhhhhhhhhhh!"
{{%nl%}}
O'Bunny whatever you wish.
{{%nl%}}
My witness,
{{%nl%}}
Bear witness
{{%nl%}}
To my grantin of yours,
{{%nl%}}
But Bunny, O'Bunny, my bed's basement cannot be yours.
