The wind whistles and howls,{{%nl%}}
It runs by the surface of our hills {{%nl%}}
terrorizing the grass below. {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

In their desperation, {{%nl%}}
Attempting to avoid devastation,{{%nl%}}
They dodge. {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Back and forth they sway, {{%nl%}}
side to side. {{%nl%}}
They say, {{%nl%}}
They yell, "We will not relent!{{%nl%}}
"The misers may be strong but we are more!" {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

They continue to further themselves. {{%nl%}}
Spreading their roots, {{%nl%}}
Planting themselves firmly into their histories, {{%nl%}} 
They grow stronger, {{%nl%}}
The wind blows. {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

From afar they dance.
