I stand in awe before a mushroom.
{{%nl%}}
It's brown, pitted——worn——and small.
{{%nl%}}
This mushroom, though the size of my thumb is a monument.
{{%nl%}}
It is an exaltation of the network of mycelium below it.
{{%nl%}}
It is the child of a network more vast than I, all below my feet.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The mushroom sits atop the moss.
{{%nl%}}
It sprouts through the star-shaped stems it now protects, casting shade on the moss below it...
{{%nl%}}
on the moss which protected it as it grew.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Above all stands a once stout sapling that ascended to tree-hood.
{{%nl%}}
Its conception from the falling of a seed which thought no more of itself than the dirt it was buried in.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

It grew. The seed sprouted, miraculously discovering which way is up with no senses to call its own.
{{%nl%}}
Its sprouts push through the moss and mushrooms above it with the fungi feasting on the seeds which were not so lucky, forced to rot.
{{%nl%}}
The mushroom means no harm in its feeding,
{{%nl%}}
it is simply continuing.
{{%nl%}}
It is nature; here, there is no beauty without sacrifice.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Time passes.
{{%nl%}}
A branch falls.
The wind roaring past its leaves, a branch splits and falls with its leaves tagging along.
{{%nl%}}
With no choice to go anywhere but where the wind will take them, they rest on the ground.
{{%nl%}}
The branch, with its rings of growth, relaxes on the young moss.
{{%nl%}}
The leaves do the same.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I was not here when this branch fell in the woods--nor was anyone.
{{%nl%}}
But I am here to witness its peaceful but fleeting coexistence with the forest floor.
{{%nl%}}
I continue with my hike,
and I am not there to hear them falls once more;
{{%nl%}}
whether a branch falling, a mushroom sprouting, or some moss spreading,{{%nl%}}
their stories continue. As do I.
