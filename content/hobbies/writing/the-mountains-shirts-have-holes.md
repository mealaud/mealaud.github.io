The mountains rest.{{%nl%}}
They sleep peacefully, happily, unstirringly night and day.{{%nl%}}
They rest as the wind blows and bellows across.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The trees leave them be. {{%nl%}}
They dig their roots into their skin,{{%nl%}}
into their flesh,{{%nl%}}
but they don't mind.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The trees,{{%nl%}}
in becoming part of them,{{%nl%}}
turn into their clothes.{{%nl%}}
The imperfect canopy reveals their rocky skin.{{%nl%}}
Their shirts have holes.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}
