He rises. {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The knights, peacefully resting, wait for their next beckoning. They hold their breath as their king rises over the foothills, inching towards his kingdom’s highest point. {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

In his divine righteousness, he spreads rays of golden hope, promising a new day free from the strains of the last. Invigorated, his knights turn to bundles of fire and flames, transforming into a perfect inferno of red and orange. Their enchanting aggression lays siege to the blue plains, expanding the territory in which their kingdom lies.  {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

He reaches the kingdom’s apex.
