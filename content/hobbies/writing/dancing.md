I walk home in the moonlight.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The pale glow reflected off the stone above illuminates the path in front of me.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The powder glows and dances on the wind.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I see what I often cannot —— {{%nl%}}
in the pure white  {{%nl%}}
—— a lack of vibrance {{%nl%}}
is replaced by an ecstatic brilliance.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The beauty is subtle, but enamoring.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The snow waltzes in the pale moonlight. {{%nl%}}
I choose to dance with it.
