He jumps across the small flow.
{{%nl%}}
It's freezing but he's careful.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

He reaches for the rock and grips the moss.
{{%nl%}}
His hand sinks seemingly forever;
{{%nl%}}
his other hand grips an icicle from the small overhang.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

He jumps back to the path, living torch in-hand,
{{%nl%}}
and he hands it to me.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I am entranced.
{{%nl%}}
So enamored that I forget the icicle is freezing.
{{%nl%}}
So enamored that I have no choice but to smile.
{{%nl%}}
I love my moss.
{{%nl%}}
I love my friend more.
