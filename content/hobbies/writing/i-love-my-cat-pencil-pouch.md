I have a cat pencil pouch.
{{%nl%}}
I have an adorable little cat pencil pouch!
{{%nl%}}
He is brown and the bag itself is beige.
{{%nl%}}
He telescopes so he can get on all fours and look at me, or stand up straight and gander.
{{%nl%}}
His eyes are a simple black,
{{%nl%}}
Like a sharpie pressed against a page,
{{%nl%}}
with all potential and creativity right in front of them.
{{%nl%}}
His front legs hang his little paws over his chest, just over his belly.
{{%nl%}}
His hind legs keep him upright.
{{%nl%}}
He never falters.
{{%nl%}}
He never gets stuck.
{{%nl%}}
I can always give him a quick belly scratch if I need to recenter.
{{%nl%}}
I can always give him a little head scratch if I need a pen.
{{%nl%}}
My cat pencil pouch is perfect.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Everyday in class, I show him off.
{{%nl%}}
To my friends who've seen him a thousand times,
{{%nl%}}
and to classmates who've never have,
{{%nl%}}
I introduce them all the same.
{{%nl%}}
"Look how cute he is!"
{{%nl%}}
"Look! He stands!"
{{%nl%}}
"Look! He sits!"
{{%nl%}}
My cat pencil pouch is perfect.
{{%nl%}}
But that doesn't mean he's free from teasing.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

People make jokes about taking him and hiding him from me.
{{%nl%}}
People make jokes about stealing him.
{{%nl%}}
I know these jokes are all in good fun so I don't worry at first,
{{%nl%}}
But sometimes I get worried about how _he_ feels.
{{%nl%}}
I get worried how my perfect little cat pencil pouch feels.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

He's done so much for me.
{{%nl%}}
He keeps me ready to write wherever I go.
{{%nl%}}
He keeps my notepad so I can scribble when needed.
{{%nl%}}
He keeps my pen refills so my thoughts never stutter.
{{%nl%}}
But what have I done for him?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

A few years ago, I put a sharpie in my pouch and it spilled some ink.
{{%nl%}}
I can still see the little stains on his head.
{{%nl%}}
I can still see the little blotches by his feet.
{{%nl%}}
I can still see all the mistakes I've made with him.
{{%nl%}}
But he never judges me.
{{%nl%}}
He never refuses to open.
{{%nl%}}
He never keeps me from writing.
{{%nl%}}
He helps me during all my exams,
{{%nl%}}
He helps me calm down.
{{%nl%}}
He helps me learn.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Thank you, cat pencil pouch.
{{%nl%}}
I love you a lot.
{{%nl%}}
I hope you love me too.
