I am unmoved. The heavens begin to slip off my shoulders, but I am unmoved.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I do not reach.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I do not grasp.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I do not attempt.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

It rolls down my back as I attempt to stay still. I have not maintained my world.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

My world falls into the abyss, tattered and left to rot by the one who must maintain its sanctity. Is my apathy not sacrilegious? Am I not shirking my most sacred of responsibilities to stand still and be unprovoked by the heavens falling further and further into the deep black of the cosmos?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I am unmoved.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I do not reach.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I do not grasp.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I do not attempt.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Am I so uncaring about my world, my responsibilities that I would let this slip? Are my essence and all its adornments worthless to me? In this moment of fear, I wonder what I may become.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I close my eyes to see the future and see nothing but the deepest of space—it is empty. It is nothing. I am nothing.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

How can I forgive myself for the things I do not become?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I open my eyes to the world in which I inhabit as the heavens begin to fade into the background. I see my life as it is. I see the life I have created.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I close my eyes once more. I see the world in which I want to live. Not one filled with nothing, not one with a dearth of care and love, but one that mimics the hopes and dreams I’ve held near and dear for the longest of times.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I realize that my goals, my dreams, my hopes, are my sacred commandments. I realize that these aspirations are not optional. I realize:

>>> It is not a matter of if I can, I must.

I move.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I reach.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I grasp.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I succeed.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The heavens are above me once more.
