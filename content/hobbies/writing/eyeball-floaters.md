I sit on my porch.
{{%nl%}}
The rain is falling. Slowly, at least.
{{%nl%}}
It's calm, it's comforting,
{{%nl%}}
It's a rare, cold coziness.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I look up at my rain clouds above.
{{%nl%}}
They don't seem too upset but they still cry.
{{%nl%}}
I wipe my eyes and immediately my floaters come to comfort me.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

They don't do much; it's what they like to do.
{{%nl%}}
My floaters, my friends, live on my eyes and look around with me.
{{%nl%}}
They experience the world with me.
{{%nl%}}
I wonder if they see what I see. I hope not.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Some of them look like beads on a string
{{%nl%}}
rattling around on a wrist too small.
{{%nl%}}
Sometimes a wrist too big.
{{%nl%}}
Sometimes it's just right.
{{%nl%}}
I wonder what they think of my eyes.
{{%nl%}}
I hope they think it's just right.
{{%nl%}}
Even if it's not, I don't want them to leave.
{{%nl%}}
They've been with me since I was little.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I still feel little sometimes.
{{%nl%}}
I like feeling like a kid.
{{%nl%}}
This sense of wonder and love for the world around me,
{{%nl%}}
it's beautiful; it stops me from thinking.
{{%nl%}}
Staring at my floaters, I feel serenity, not numbness.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I think too much; or feel, I guess.
{{%nl%}}
I wonder what my friends feel.
{{%nl%}}
I wonder what they feel when I dart my eyes left and right, up and down.
{{%nl%}}
How do they feel being dragged?
{{%nl%}}
They chose to be here with me, I suppose.
{{%nl%}}
But do they deserve it?
{{%nl%}}
Our beads still seem fastened to each; the string isn't broken.
{{%nl%}}
Maybe it's fine.
{{%nl%}}
I think I'm feeling too much.
{{%nl%}}
I feel I'm thinking too much.
{{%nl%}}
I want to look up to my floaters more often.
