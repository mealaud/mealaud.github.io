summary: "A profile on a well respected and loved cat in my neighborhood. (With a line inspired by Ben Manifold of the Chime-In Open Mic.)"
---

My roommate loves an orange cat in our neighborhood.
{{%nl%}}
His name is Mr. Stinker and he gains more respect with every appearance.
{{%nl%}}
Now he is Stinkerton.
{{%nl%}}
Then Dr. Stinkerton.
{{%nl%}}
Then Rev. Dr. Stinkerton.
{{%nl%}}
Then Rev. Dr. Stinkerton IV.
{{%nl%}}
He is quite distink-guished.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Logan, my roommate, says he just has "stinky vibes", in a loving way.
{{%nl%}}
Rev. Dr. Stinkerton IV is nto actually stinky.
{{%nl%}}
But I wonder what he smells like after it rains.
{{%nl%}}
Recently it's been raining like hell.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I'm sure stinker is afraid of hawks and vultures but I wonder if rain, torrential, is a cosmic entity to him too.
{{%nl%}}
Is a thunderstorm storm constantly cracking the sky eldritch?
{{%nl%}}
I wonder what he thinks about things that seem beyond him.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I think he's brave.
{{%nl%}}
He's brave enough to continue at least.
{{%nl%}}
I revere our bless-ed reverend for this.
