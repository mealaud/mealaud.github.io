I see a monolith in the distance.
Immediately, I am humbled.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I stand in awe in what stands before me all the while they are unphased by my presence.
Am I so small they do not sense me?
They turn and begin to look at me affectionately. 
I smile back.

In their smile, I can feel their nostalgia.
But for what are they nostalgic for?
Why have I caused this emotion?

I wave and yell for them: "Hello! Who are you?" 
In their surprisingly kind voice, they say "I am you. I am a hope for times better and lives to come."
I stare at them ponderously, unable to understand.

As I stand confused, they walk further from me. 
I sprint after them as long as I can and then some.
By the time they stop, we are just as far from each other as we were before.
They look at me and smile once again, even wider than the first.
They say 
"You are a time better. You are life that came."

I turn around and see a small man.
He stands sheepishly but with great humility.
I look at him affectionately.
