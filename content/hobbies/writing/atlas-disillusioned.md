I look.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I stare.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I ponder.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

What did I see before?
What do I see now?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Staring into the nothingness around me, I see nothing.
I sense nothing.
I am without stimulus.
But has anything changed?
No.
Then I must have changed? 
Indeed.

I look.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I stare.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I ponder.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The world above me, the greatest of my responsibilities, though firmly above my head, is odd.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

My world, the greatest of my joys, is without color.
The surreal has become mundane.
The fantastical has become conventional.
The somethings have become nothings.
