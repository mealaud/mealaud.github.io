summary: "A story of being humbled by what lies above you."

This morning, on my way out of the house, I saw that the clouds beautiful.
They were windswept and wispy, while others looked painted with strokes of varying intensity.
Some were fluffy and amicable.

After noticing these perfect, beautiful monoliths which floated above me, I drove into the hills near my house and went to the highest peak I could.

When I looked up I saw this.

I am humbled.

I for so long have been a herald of sorts for the clouds: telling my friends when to look and why, sharing what I had seen, and evangelizing about their beauty.
I did this purely because I loved clouds.
However, this time when when I looked up I felt overwhelmed.
I felt humbled.
I felt, _truly_ felt, that I was nothing in the face of these monoliths.
There seemed to be nothing above them, and I, and everything else that I have ever known, was below them.

I am nothing but what they are not——I am nothing.
