I look up.
{{%nl%}}
I look down.
{{%nl%}}
I look left.
{{%nl%}}
I look right.
{{%nl%}}
I see nothing?
{{%nl%}}
However, this is not the witnessing of darkness.
{{%nl%}}
This is not witnessing of lightness.
{{%nl%}}
This is not witnessing of something.
{{%nl%}}
This is the witnessing of _nothing_.
{{%nl%}}
Where am I? Where I oughta be.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

My essence and all its adornments,
{{%nl%}}
My desires and fears,
{{%nl%}}
My hopes and dreams,
{{%nl%}}
Are held by me, right?
{{%nl%}}
Surely surely surely its me!?
{{%nl%}}
Certainly!?! Why am I so uncertain?
{{%nl%}}
Am I not Atlas? 
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I am where I oughta be.
{{%nl%}}
I am trapped.
{{%nl%}}
In a boundless ether, submerged mind to soles, I am trapped.
{{%nl%}}
I am where I oughta be.
{{%nl%}}
I am where I oughta be.
{{%nl%}}
I am where I oughta be.
{{%nl%}}
But this is not where I want to be!
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Am I not Atlas?:
{{%nl%}}
the bearer of my world;
{{%nl%}}
the bearer of my burdens;
{{%nl%}}
the bearer of my successes;
{{%nl%}}
the bearer of my failures...
{{%nl%}}
the sole bearer of my failures.
{{%nl%}}
My soul can only bear so many failures.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I look up.
{{%nl%}}
I look down.
{{%nl%}}
I look left.
{{%nl%}}
I look right.
{{%nl%}}
I see nothing!
{{%nl%}}
Where is my world!?
{{%nl%}}
Upon my shoulder I am not being crushed under what could and should be, nor what is.
{{%nl%}}
I am trapped in this ether.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

AM I NOT ATLAS!? AM I NOT THE BEARER OF MY WORLD!? AM I NOT THE BEARER OF MY BURDENS!? AM I NOT THE BEARER OF MY SUCCESSES!?
{{%nl%}}
I certainly the bearer of my failures.
