I believe in more than the outside's above.
{{%nl%}}
I believe in me.
{{%nl%}}
The self I feel,
{{%nl%}}
The self I know,
{{%nl%}}
The self that witnesses it all,
{{%nl%}}
That is what I believe in.

{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

But I've never failed to feel small in the forest.
{{%nl%}}
In the forest, I stand tall but
{{%nl%}}
these giants, these elders,
{{%nl%}}
Voices soft and ragged, they speak kindly.
{{%nl%}}
They've seen more days than I can imagine.
{{%nl%}}
They've stared at the sky even longer than I.
{{%nl%}}
They are not jaded, however. Offering homes to even the termintes when they are in need.
{{%nl%}}
I shrink.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I genuflect at this altar cellulose and resign myself.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I've never had trouble finding God when there are trees nearby.
