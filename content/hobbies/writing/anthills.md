## Clouds

I went to the grocery store today.
{{%nl%}}
Although not a prime destination, I didn't know where else to go.
{{%nl%}}
I needed to get away from where I struggle so I went to the grocery store.
{{%nl%}}
I bought some pasta and chicken so I could make some dinner later.
{{%nl%}}
I don't know what I want to eat.
{{%nl%}}
I don't know if I want to eat.
{{%nl%}}
I'm not sure.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

There is so much and so little happening in each and every instance.
{{%nl%}}
I am properly whelmed. 
{{%nl%}}
Averaged between the over- and under-, I am constantly switching between being cripplingly overwhelmed and paralyzingly under-.
{{%nl%}}

I walk past the baking sheets.
{{%nl%}}
You know; the big foil ones that are (apparently) marketed towards big pasta dishes.
{{%nl%}}
Maybe it would be nice to get one for tonight.
{{%nl%}}
I bought 2 pounds of pasta. It was 99 cents.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

I'm struggling to look up.
{{%nl%}}
Not because the sun is too bright or I can't handle the beauty of my monoliths,
{{%nl%}}
I just can't bring myself to look after what happened today:
{{%nl%}}
I looked up at the clouds and felt nothing.
{{%nl%}}

{{%nl%}}
I don't know what this means.
{{%nl%}}
I know it's bad.
{{%nl%}}
It's not just the feeling of nothing its the feeling of longing for feeling something!
{{%nl%}}
I want to see my clouds and smile.
{{%nl%}}
I want to see my clouds and be reminded of the beauty native to our world.
{{%nl%}}
I want to stand at my bus-stop and look up and around and feel the emotional comfort and warmth of a pristine ball of fluff in the land above.
{{%nl%}}

{{%nl%}}
These blue plains.
{{%nl%}}
These blue plains are barren of emotion... mine at least.
{{%nl%}}
They're chock-ful of clouds. 
{{%nl%}}
They're so empty of thought.
{{%nl%}}
I'm projecting aren't I?
{{%nl%}}

{{%nl%}}
I'm scared.
{{%nl%}}
I don't know of what.
{{%nl%}}
I'm more scared of when.
{{%nl%}}
I'm terrified I won't look up again.
{{%nl%}}

{{%nl%}}
I kneel.
{{%nl%}}
I am kneeling to a God in which I don't believe, praying for my nothings to be sweet,
{{%nl%}}
and my everything to wondrous.
{{%nl%}}
I'm afraid that my final day of cloud-watching has gone.
{{%nl%}}
I'm afraid of when.
