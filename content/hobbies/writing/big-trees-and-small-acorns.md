When I would go to the gym in the fall,
{{%nl%}}
I'd walk across campus and see the trees.
{{%nl%}}
Those trees were big.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

They were approaching their weakest.
{{%nl%}}
Winter was creeping across the grass and the trees would soon hibernate.
{{%nl%}}
Or at least I think so. I don't know much about trees.
{{%nl%}}
One thing I do know is that I love their acorns.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

I would be late to the gym every day because I'd roam around in the grass staring straight down looking for my little treasures.
{{%nl%}}
Sometimes I'd find acorns still attached to a branch or a stick.
{{%nl%}}
Sometimes a few of them were bunched up.
{{%nl%}}
Those were the coolest.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

More commonly I'd find their little hats.
{{%nl%}}
All I ever wanted to do was give it back to them.
{{%nl%}}
I'm sure their little acorn heads were cold.
{{%nl%}}
They don't want to freeze!
{{%nl%}}
Or at least I wouldn't want to.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

Usually there were a lot more acorn hats than acorns,
{{%nl%}}
so I usually just stuck them to my finger tips.
{{%nl%}}
I'm sure that would've been their second favorite place.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

I don't know if my acorns remember me.
{{%nl%}}
I don't know if I remember them all that well either.
{{%nl%}}
I don't think either of us could pick the other out in a crowd.
{{%nl%}}
But I hope they're turning into big trees now.
{{%nl%}}
I wonder what they hoped for me.
