I close my eyes often. {{%nl%}}
Beyond blinking I choose to close them to imagine what has been, is, and can be.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I used to close my eyes and wish to open them to a new world,{{%nl%}}
To see the light of hope in another life,{{%nl%}}
To see all of this through eyes which were not my own.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Recently when I close my eyes I imagine what can be --- what *I* can be.{{%nl%}}
I don't wish for another life.{{%nl%}}
I see that mine can be made better.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I open my eyes.
