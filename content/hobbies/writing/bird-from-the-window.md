I am outside.

The bird which has never set foot inside is outside too.

He flies and chirps and in his unstaged performances, he enamors me.

Bird not from the window, am I in yours?
{{%nl%}}
You, from your tree, see me and chirp. Have I ever been inside your nature?
{{%nl%}}
As I sit, there is a beautiful breeze. It's cool and calming.
{{%nl%}}
The bird is still chirping. What am I still doing here?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Bird not from my window, you always look through mine, can I look through yours?
