I feel the damp, soft grass push lightly against my back as I watch the puffy clouds transform above. I stare and I see a beautiful, fluffy, poorly drawn rabbit. He doesnâ€™t seem to move much. {{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The wind bellows and leaves ruffle around me as my homely rabbit morphs into something a little more exciting. Fangs erupt from his mouth, his body elongates and curves, his button tail is grabbed and pulled by a gust, while his back is blown into curved wings. My beautiful bunny rabbit has morphed into a big, strong dragon.
