I've been treading mud.
{{%nl%}}
Every day has been awful
{{%nl%}}
Budding inadequacy,
{{%nl%}}
I am blossoming into someone I don't want to become!
{{%nl%}}
A dis-passionate flower.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

Passion flowers are my favorite. 
{{%nl%}}
They were blue and purple and white? I'm not sure about the purple
{{%nl%}}
(I'm very colorblind)
{{%nl%}}
but they're beautiful.
{{%nl%}}
They also have these goofy little dangling arms that sit on them like watch hands;
{{%nl%}}
I need those watch hands, I can't tell how much time passes when I see them.
{{%nl%}}
It's beautiful.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

Sometimes I wish I was a passion flower.
{{%nl%}}
I have dangly arms and they _could_ act like a watch (or a sundial),
{{%nl%}}
but I've been struggling.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

Most flowers, 
{{%nl%}}
especially the passion flower,
{{%nl%}}
soar out of the mud and into the skies 
{{%nl%}}
(or closer to a few feet high).
{{%nl%}}
The dis-passionate flower treads mud.
{{%nl%}}
Or at least it's been feeling like it.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

I wish that when I look at myself
{{%nl%}}
the moments wouldn't drag on.
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

I wish I was the flower I so adore. I can be. 
{{%nl%}}
I'm treading mud to plow the fields.
{{%nl%}}
My struggles now seed my growth later.
