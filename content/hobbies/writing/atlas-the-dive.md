I am unburdened.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I am unburdened not because I have surmounted the seemingly-insurmountable, but because I have forgotten the weight I bear. It seems impossible that I could forget to carry my life, my responsibilities, my hopes, my dreams, but with a lack of clarity, things that may seem at the forefront of your mind may disappear into this all-too-powerful fog. I lost focus.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I forget.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I forget what I enjoyed and what I despised. I forget what I loved and what I feared. I have lost my identity, my sense of personhood. I am nothing but now what I am not. I am nothing.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

How can I be burdened if there is nothing I hold dear, if there is no responsibility, if there is no passion?{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Before I realize that I am in this enchanting fog, my world rolls off my shoulders and into the cold dark of the cosmos — I have shrugged without knowing. There is nothing quite so painful as realizing you have not done all that you could.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

It falls further.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

The abyss beckons me and calls out, “Follow your world. You are not fit to maintain it. You are not fit to maintain yourself.” Without a moment’s thought, I agree.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I feel the weight of my world on my shoulders.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

How could this be possible? My world had disappeared before my eyes and I did nothing to slow its descent. Under this immense stress I realize: this is not the weight of my reality, but instead of what could have been. How do we bear the weight of an entire reality unrealized? How can I forgive myself for what I have not become?{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I dive.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I begin to act on what is, burdened by the weight of what could have been, to attain what can be. I jump into the abyss’s dark embrace and race to reach my world. As I get closer, I hear a familiar voice reaching out to me: “Continue following your world. You are not fit to maintain it.” Without a moment’s thought, I disagree.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I reach.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I grasp.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I hoist.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I carry.{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

I feel the weight of my world on my shoulders.
