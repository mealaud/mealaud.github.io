I am not who I want to be.
{{%nl%}}
I am not who I ought to be.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

A combination of fore-, after-, and -thought has shown me a dramatic view of the future.
{{%nl%}}
I close my eyes and witness it once more.
{{%nl%}}
After having seen it, how can I forgive myself if I do not become?
{{%nl%}}
How can I forgive myself for the things I do not become?
{{%nl%}}
How can I?
{{%nl%}}
Should I?
{{%nl%}}
I?
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Who am I if not the sum and product of all which constitutes me?
{{%nl%}}
My beliefs, my choices, my actions;
{{%nl%}}
these are me.
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

Who am I if not my innate mundaneity?
{{%nl%}}
My thoughts, my unconscious decisions, my habits.
{{%nl%}}
_These are me._
{{%nl%}}{{%nl%}}

When I close my eyes, I see someone happy, healthy and hardworking.
{{%nl%}}
I see someone restraint by _their_ choices, _their_ wants, and _their_ needs.
{{%nl%}}
I do not see someone falling for the folly that is unconstrained choice.
{{%nl%}}
An axiom of mine.
{{%nl%}}
There is no freedom without restraint.
