I open my car door. 
{{%nl%}}
It's hot.
{{%nl%}}
I'm not sure what I came here for; besides water.
{{%nl%}}
I wanted water.
{{%nl%}}
I wasn't thirsty, though.

{{%nl%}}

I step out of my car.
{{%nl%}}
It's so hot!
{{%nl%}}
{{%nl%}}

I step onto the shore.
{{%nl%}}
It's Jordan Lake; it's beautiful.
{{%nl%}}
The bugs want me; I suppose I'm warm blooded.
{{%nl%}}
I look around and feel.
{{%nl%}}
I didn't ask anyone to join me.
{{%nl%}}
I've resigned to doing things alone.
{{%nl%}}
I never step in the water.
{{%nl%}}
I still feel cold.
