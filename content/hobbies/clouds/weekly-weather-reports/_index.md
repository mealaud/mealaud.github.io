I like taking photos of clouds. Often. For this reason, I'd like ot compile a "weekly weather report" on the clouds I saw this past week. :) I made this decision a little bit ago, then forgot about it, then remembered, so I will have one big weather report for my pre-college era and another for May 2023. Otherwise, it will be weekly.
