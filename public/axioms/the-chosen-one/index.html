    <h1>The Chosen One<span style="opacity: 0.5; font-size: 0.5em">    Sunday, June 1, 2025</span></h1>
  </header>
  <p>Some months ago I started to write a post about who I wanted to be as a student, but never finished it.
Now my scope is my life in general.
Who do I choose to be (in actions, beliefs, etc.)?
In no particular order, and I do not claim this to be comprehensive:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>The past is not any indication of the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When I lived with my roommate Kyle is undergrad, we would occasionally go to the gym together.
I stopped going pretty soon but he <em>always</em> invited me.
He extended his hand to help me and I, in an act of intense moral failure, almost always said: &ldquo;If the past is any indication of the future, I will not be gym-ing today.&rdquo;
At first he took it as me passing and then went to the gym by himself.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I still appreciate all the times he asked me, but the time that stands out most to me was when he said &ldquo;Mel, that is a terrible way of thinking&rdquo; and explained to me how I&rsquo;m using it to excuse doing something I <em>want</em> to do.
I was using my past to predict my future.
More than that, <strong>I was foregoing who I wanted to be using what I was before.</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I refuse to fall into this trap once again.
The past does not predict the future nor does anything else.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;If the past is any indication of the future&rdquo; is a worthless statement. it&rsquo;s evil and immoral.</p>
<p>While heading home on the bus recently, I was curious about complacency; specifically, my complacency.
My graduate-school career has been marred by lows and elevated by highs, but I have had far more lows than highs.
In some sense, I am below where I was in undergrad.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>In undergrad, I was not a good student.
However, I suppose it was not necessary yet to develop such skills.
I didn&rsquo;t learn how to study; I didn&rsquo;t learn how to trudge; I didn&rsquo;t learn how to learn.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>As a graduate student, I was expected to have come in with these basic abilities mastered and practiced.
Like I said above, I haven&rsquo;t, however.
<br>
<br></p>
<p>What are the characteristics I&rsquo;m missing that I want to possess?
Academically:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to be willing to do and to actually do problems which seem &ldquo;unenlightening&rdquo; or &ldquo;ugly&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been refusing to do questions that seem like or are (admittedly) a <em>grind</em>.
You must trudge through the problem to get some form of solution.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I want to review, study, practice what I have not mastered.</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular, I&rsquo;ve taken 5 exams this semester: 2 have gone mediocre-ly, and the 3 remaining have gone <em>terribly</em>.
Both subjects I want to want to care about, and often do, but I have this belief in me that it will be okay.
That if I just do my homework, I will achieve my goals and succeed.
That if I just do my requirements, I will ascend and surpass what I had envisioned for myself.
Currently, I just get the bad score, stare at it, feel bad, don&rsquo;t change anything, and repeat the cycle when after the next exam comes around.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I heard from my roommate, that a professor of ours told an admittedly funny joke: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re smart and lazy, do algebra. If you&rsquo;re smart and hardworking, do topology. If you&rsquo;re just hardworking, do analysis.&rdquo;
I want to qualify for doing whatever I would like to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to be smart and hardworking.
But often times, I fall short and feel irreparably so.
But this is not the case.</p>
<p>One thing I often say while playing Rocket League, I repeatedly say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not over until it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;ll be down 5 goals with 5 seconds left and it looks that I will lose.
I often do.
Regardless, I do not give up.
Even after I&rsquo;ve lost, I don&rsquo;t give up hope.
I can win next time.
This is not kicking-the-can-down-the-road, it is the belief that I can improve if I don&rsquo;t give up.
I can improve if I don&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to give up.</li>
</ol>
