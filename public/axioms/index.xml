      <description>&lt;p&gt;While heading home on the bus today, I was curious about complacency; specifically, my complacency.&#xA;My graduate-school career has been marred by lows and elevated by highs, but I have had far more lows than highs.&#xA;In some sense, I am below where I was in undergrad.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In undergrad, I was not a good student.&#xA;However, I suppose it was not necessary yet to develop such skills.&#xA;I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn how to study; I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn how to trudge; I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn how to learn.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
