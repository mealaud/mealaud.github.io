One of his plane\u0026rsquo;s engines is dying and he needs to fly for another 10 miles, but how can he do this? Though we don\u0026rsquo;t follow his actions in their complexity and depth, he does! Indeed, he must understand what he\u0026rsquo;s doing and be ready to execute at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice just as he did. This leads us to our first definition in this book, that of learning.\nLearning is the act of acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and opportunities.\nThe authors then state three facts.\nTo be useful, learning requires memory, so what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned is still there later when we need it. We need to keep learning and remembering all our lives.1 Learning is an acquired skill, and the most effective strategies are often counterintuitive.2 Claims we Make in This Book Learning is deeper and more durable when it takes effort. They say that easy learning is like writing in sand and so it disappears very quickly. I think this makes a lot of sense to me as when I study math (or really do anything with a lot of effort), I really learn it well. I remember it at the least. Like I\u0026rsquo;ve worked with topological spaces so much that if you woke me up in the middle of the night, I think I\u0026rsquo;d quickly give the correct definition of what a topology is.\nWe are poor judges of when we are learning well and when we\u0026rsquo;re not. When learning is taking time and feels slow, it feels unproductive, so we often jump ship for methods that promise faster results even if these results are temporary!! (Not that we know a priori). This makes sense\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve done this too much in the past.\nRereading text and massed practice of a skill or new knowledge are by far the preferred study strategies for most people, but they\u0026rsquo;re also among the least productive. For reference, massed practive means the single-minded, rapid fire repetition of something you\u0026rsquo;re trying to burn into memory. (cf. the idea of \u0026ldquo;practice-practice-practice\u0026rdquo; that people usually talk about). They say further that cramming via rereading and massed practice give rise to feelings of fluency that seem to indicate mastery, but with true mastery and durability of knowledge as a goal, cramming is largely a waste of time. I suddenly feel quite ashamed lmfao.\nRetrieval practice , meaning recalling facts or concepts or events from memory, is a more effective learning strategy than rereading. Flashcards are a simple example. Retrieval strengthens the memory and interrupts the process of forgetting. (Wow! I\u0026rsquo;ve never thought of that before!) A single simple quiz after reading or after a lecture greatly enhances learning and remembering than just rereading or reviewing lecture notes. The brain is not a muscle but the neural pathways that make up the body of learning do get stronger when the memory is retrieved and the learning is practiced. Periodic practice (like we mentioned before) interrupts the process of forgetting, strengthens retrieval routes, and is essential for hanging onto the knowledge you want to gain.\nSpacing out practice and getting a little rusty between sessions, or you interleave the practice of two or more subjects retrieval is hard and feels less productive, but the effort produces longer lasting learning and enables for versatile application of it in later settings.\nTrying to solve a problem before being taught the solution leads to better learning, even when the errors are made in the attempt.\nThe idea that you learn better when you receive instruction in a form consistent with your preferred learning style is not supported by empirical research.\nMoreover, you learn better when you draw on all of your aptitudes and resourcefulness, than when you limit instruction or experience to the style you find most amenable.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;re good at extracting the underlying principles or \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; that differentiate types of problems, you\u0026rsquo;re more successful at picking the right solutions in unfamiliar situations. This skill is better acquired through interleaved and varied practice than massed practice.\nWe are all susceptible to illusions that cna hijack our judgement of what we know and can do. Testing helps calibrate our judgements of what we\u0026rsquo;ve learned. In virtually all areas of learning, you build better mastery when you use testing as a tool to identify and bring up your areas of weakness.\nAll new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge. For example, you need to know what a limit is before you can learn what an integral or derivative is.\nIf you just engage in mechanical repetition, you can hit the limit of what you can keep in mind, but if you practice elaboration, there is no known limit to how much you can learn. Elaboration is the process of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with the what you already know. The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be, and the more connections you create will help you remember it later.\nPutting new knowledge into a larger context helps learning. e.g., If you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn an abstraction, it\u0026rsquo;s easier when you ground it in something concrete that you already know.\nPeople who learn to extract key ideas from new material and organize them into a mental model and connect that model to prior knowledge show an advantage in learning complex mastery. A mental model is a mental representations of some external reality.\nMany people believe that their intellectual ability is hard-wired from birth, and that failure ot meet a learning challenge is an indictment of their native ability, but every time you learn something new, you change the brain. We start our life with our initial conditions (genes), sure, but it\u0026rsquo;s also true that we become capable through the learning and development of mental models that enable us to reason, solve, and create. i.e., The elements that shape your intellectual abilities lie to a surprising extent within your own control. Understanding this enables you to see failure as a badge of effort and a source of useful information —— needing to go deeper or try a different strategy. You need to understand that when learning is hard, you\u0026rsquo;re doing important work. To understand that striving and setbacks, are essential if you are to surpass your current level of performance towards true expertise. Making mistakes and correcting them builds the bridges to advanced learning.\nEmpirical Evidence versus Theory, Lore, and Intuition People Misunderstand Learning People often think enough exposures to something means it will not be forgotten. This is not the case.\nMany teachers believe that if they can make learning easier and faster, the learning will be better. This is not the case.\nResearch actually says the opposite! Research tells us that when learning is harder, it\u0026rsquo;s stronger and lasts longer.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s widely believed by teachers, trainers, and coaches that the most effective way to master a new skill is to give it dogged single-minded focus, practicing over and over until you\u0026rsquo;ve got it down. We often have a lot of faith in this one because this is how most make fast gains during the learning phase of massed practice. This is not the case. Research tells us that these achieved gains are transient and are lost quickly. Rereading stuff has three strikes against it when it comes to being an effective learning strategy: 1) it is time consuming, 2) it doesn\u0026rsquo;t result in durable memory, and 3) it often involves some kind of unwitting self-deception, as growing familiarity with the text comes to feel like mastery of the content.\nThe hours immersed in rereading can seem like due diligence, but the amount of study time is no measure of mastery.\nLearning is stronger when it matters, when the abstract is made concrete and personal.\nEarly Evidence In a study, it was found that exposure did not increase retention. This has been reproduced, confirmed, and elaborated to get that repetition does not lead to good long-term memory. Upshot of some studies: it makes sense to reread a text once if there\u0026rsquo;s been a meaningful lapse of time since the first reading, but doing multiple readings in close succession is a time consuming study strategy that yields negligible benefits at the expense of much more effective strategies that take less time.\nIllusions of Knowing They also say that if you\u0026rsquo;re good at learning you have an advantage in life.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nWe will be persuaded of this later.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","relpermalink":"/academics/make-it-stick/learning-is-misunderstood-v1/","title":"Learning Is Misunderstood V1"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI see a monolith in the distance.\nImmediately, I am humbled.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand in awe in what stands before me all the while they are unphased by my presence.\nAm I so small they do not sense me?\nThey turn and begin to look at me affectionately.\nI smile back.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their smile, I can feel their nostalgia.\nBut for what are they nostalgic for?\nWhy have I caused this emotion?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wave and yell for them: \u0026ldquo;Hello!
