I do not grasp. I do not attempt. Am I so uncaring about my world, my responsibilities that I would let this slip? Are my essence and all its adornments worthless to me? In this moment of fear, I wonder what I may become. I close my eyes to see the future and see nothing but the deepest of space—it is empty. It is nothing. I am nothing. How can I forgive myself for the things I do not become? I open my eyes to the world in which I inhabit as the heavens begin to fade into the background. I see my life as it is. I see the life I have created. I close my eyes once more. I see the world in which I want to live. Not one filled with nothing, not one with a dearth of care and love, but one that mimics the hopes and dreams I’ve held near and dear for the longest of times. I realize that my goals, my dreams, my hopes, are my sacred commandments. I realize that these aspirations are not optional. I realize:\nIt is not a matter of if I can, I must.\nI move. I reach.
